# Scenario

You are part of a team of data analysts that was contracted by the National Health Services (NHS), a publicly funded healthcare system in England. The NHS incurs significant, potentially avoidable, costs when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments. The reasons for missed appointments need to be better understood as explained by The British Medical Association (BMA) chair Professor Philip Banfield:

While it is frustrating when patients do not attend, the reasons why this happens should be investigated rather than simply resorting to punishing them. Financially penalising patients inevitably impact the poorest and most vulnerable in the community (GP Practice News 2022). 

Therefore, reducing or eliminating missed appointments would be beneficial financially as well as socially. The government needs a data-informed approach to deciding how best to handle this problem. At this stage of the project the two main questions posed by the NHS are:

Has there been adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
What was the actual utilisation of resources?
